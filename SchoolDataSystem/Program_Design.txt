Program Layout

A main menu that allows the user to select each table type to edit

example main menu

------School Name------
--student--enrollment--
--Program--EmrContact--
--------Course---------

this will be buttons for the five tables one can edit, and lead them to submenus for each button. 
notes:
	perhaps we can add a exit button or about button as well much like norberts assignments
	this is going to be the main hub for the program so nothing will be loaded

Sub Menus

Each table will get a menu that is similar to the other.
basically they will all contain the same format

Sub Menu example

--------------------------------------
-[                ]----Where data-----
-[ Table of data  ]----is updated-----
-[                ]-------------------
-[                ]--BackBtn--update--
---------------------create--delete---
--------------------------------------

notes:
	table of data:
		each table of data will have only the colomns of the table it is editing within the database
		Example: course will have 3 columns. id, section coursename.
		then when you click on a item within the table of data that data will populate the text boxes on the right
		which will then allow you to edit and delete or create new.
the back button will return back to the main menu which will then have a close or exit program button
no need for another about box.
perhaps having the program name still visible will be useful but its hard to say.


I will attempt to have one of the menus done as to allow you to see the menthod we are using for data editing and manipulation
this will make it so the ui and back end program works correctly and easier to debug
